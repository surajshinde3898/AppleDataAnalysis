**Data Processing Workflow**


Step 1: Reading Data
We start by reading data from multiple sources:

CSV files
Parquet files
Delta Tables


Step 2: Factory Pattern
Using the factory pattern, we have implemented factory methods to efficiently extract and load data from these diverse sources.

Step 3: Transforming Data
The data is then transformed using PySpark, enabling powerful and scalable data processing.

Step 4: Storing Data
Finally, the transformed data is stored in:

Delta Tables for efficient updates and time travel queries.
Data Lake for long-term storage and further analysis.






**Steps to Run the Project**


Step 1: Clone this Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

"git clone <repository-url>"


Step 2: Import the AppleAnalysis.zip File into Databricks
Navigate to the Databricks workspace.
Go to the Workspace section.
Click on Import and select AppleAnalysis.zip from your local machine.


Step 3: Add Data Files to Databricks DBFS
Upload the necessary data files to Databricks DBFS (Databricks File System).


Step 4: Run the Apple_Analysis Notebook
Open the apple_analysis notebook in Databricks and run all cells to execute the data processing workflow.
